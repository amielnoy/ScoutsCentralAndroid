# Scouts Central Android (Java)

Native Android rewrite of the web app, including all screens: Dashboard, Members, Activities, Progress, Communication, and Reports.

## Supabase placeholders
Update these files with your project credentials and real implementation:
- `android-app/app/src/main/java/com/scoutscentral/app/data/SupabaseConfig.java`
- `android-app/app/src/main/java/com/scoutscentral/app/data/SupabaseService.java`

## Open in Android Studio
Open the `android-app` folder as a project.

## Notes
- UI and state are implemented with Fragments + ViewModels and in-memory placeholder data.
- Remote images are represented with local placeholders; plug in Glide/Coil when you add networking.
